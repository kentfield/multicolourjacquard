multicolourjacquard
===================

GUI to take in a multi-colour image and output a pattern file that can be used with the knitting_machine repo

This is the first basic version of the app. It assumes that the compiled exe is run from c:\knitulator\, and that this folder 
contains a configured and running set-up of https://github.com/kentfield/knitting_machine/tree/Brother950i
